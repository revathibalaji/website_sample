               <h5>Vineeth Madhusudanan</h5>
               Group Manager, Microsoft India<br>
               “Shanmugavel was a good intern with our team. Things that stood out with Shan included – his enthusiasm to take on things,the ability to learn new things swiftly and the ability to work hard. Once he finished college,he successfully interviewed with and was hired into a Microsoft IT team – where he seems to have continued to do well.”
               <br><br>
               <h5>Satyendra Sinha</h5>
               Director, Microsoft<br> 
               “A strong and energetic process-oriented professional who has a passion for things related to IT security.Pleasure to work with.” 
               <br><br>
               <h5>Jebakumar Swvigaradoss</h5>
               Group Program manager<br> 
               “Shan has been extremely useful in some of the initiatives that we undertook. His participation and contribution cannot be undermined especially in the Charity show that we conducted, PMI and the Toastmasters club. During the process of working with him in these activities, I found him to be collaborative,enthusiastic, can drive things, as well as be an excellent team player. My distinct memories of 2 instances,where I told him about an idea the day before and he went ahead and started implementing the idea by the next afternoon, cannot be forgotten. He himself has started a few initiatives and is very good at networking with people”
               <br><br>
               <h5>Parmeshwar Arewar</h5>	
               Security Engineer, Microsoft<br>
               “Shan is very proactive in providing communication about latest stuff happening in security industry.He successfully organized many extra curricular activities as part of the team. He has started many new  initiatives and communities to leverage and share people’s knowledge and experience. He is a multi talented person with great communication skills. I always wonder about his breadth of knowledge on different topics and resource fullness. He has excellent cross group collaboration capabilities. As a program manager, he has excellent customer management skills and ensured that the LOB applications are secure by working with the IT teams and security analysts to follow the Microsoft SDL-IT process during the SDLC process.”
              <br><br>
              <h5> Murugan Kumar </h5>
               Director, Microsoft<br> 
               “I always enjoyed interacting with Shan.Though I had no direct management relationship with him, he always went above and beyond to manage any issue that was brought to his attention.He was also a good listner with strong work ethics.”  
               <br><br>
              <h5>Rajesh Nagpal</h5>
               Sr Group Program Manager, Microsoft India R&D<br> 
               “I’ve seen Shan grow as an individual and a professional over 5 years at Microsoft. He started as an intern,moved on as a support analyst in another business Unit and finally found a job that he loved the most -assumed the role of a Program Manager in security services. All through in my interactions, I find Shan to be self driven, extremely passionate about his assignment and his org. He continuously looks for opportunities that would make a positive impact on the org. Shan has also taken up things outside his job – such as facilitating forums to enhance best practices, engineering excellence and pmp certification – these have got no kudos to him from his org leaders – but he has developed these forums as self sustainable ones where people meet, discuss, learn, network and apply their new found knowledge. It’s rare to find a person who does thing that he is passionate about, and not worrying about the standard thoughts of “will I get brownie points in my review” Would recommend Shan highly – would be an asset to any org he works for!”
              <br><br>
              <h5>Dennis Groves</h5>
               Architect, Microsoft <br>
               “Shanmugavel was a key stakeholder on ISRM,and the products that I developed as the PM for the Assessment and Protection team. Without his collaboration and guidance Cat.net, AntiXSS, TAM & TAMe would not have been the successful products that they are. I enjoyed working with Shanmugavel, and look forward to future opportunities to collaborate on projects together.” 
              <br><br>
              <h5>Hari Ram Prakash Karanam</h5>
               information security advisor <br> 
               “Shan is my compeer working as Information Security Advisor for couple of clients..one Health Care which I always think Shan could have only dealt with account hitches like the way he did and on of his other account he is bringing out the best with his delivery teams to stay secured and complied at account level…I am sure his customer (CFO) is happy with his delivery….kudos buddy!” 
              <br><br>

               <h5>Shashidhar CN</h5>
               CISA,CRISC,MBA, IT Security & GRC Leader – AP, IBM Global Services<br>
               “Shanmughavel (Shan) was a livewire, highly focused & result oriented Security & GRC professional/colleague and a pleasure to work with. It was a pleasure working with him & exchanging perspectives on Infosec & GRC with him while he was at IBM. All the very best in your career.”
